-= Windows =-
  
  Run the installer (Vertigo.exe) and install to your prefered location, then
  launch the game from the Start Menu.
  
  For troubleshooting Windows installations, please see below.
  
-= Mac OS X =-

  Mount the .DMG and copy the Vertigo bundle to your Applications folder, then double click it to run the game.

-= Linux =-

  a) USING THE PRECOMPILED PACKAGE

  Simply change directory to the bin folder and run play_vertigo.sh:
    cd bin/ && ./play_vertigo.sh
    
  You can create a launcher for the game by creating a softlink to the script:
    sudo ln -s $PWD/bin/play_vertigo.sh /usr/local/bin/vertigo
  Then you can run the game from anywhere by typing:
    vertigo

  b) BUILDING FROM SOURCE
  
  To build Vertigo from source, you need the following libraries:
    * Ogre3D v1.7.2 without boost-threads (http://www.ogre3d.org) which depends on:
      * zzip, freetype, and freeimage development libraries
      * OpenGL and GLUT development headers
			* nVidia CG
    * BulletPhysics v1.7.7 (http://www.bulletphysics.org/)
    * OgreOggSound v1.21 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogreoggsound/) which depends on:
      * OpenAL development libraries
      * Ogg development libraries
      * Vorbis development libraries
    * ParticleUniverse plugin (dynamic library is provided, you don't need to build this)
		* log4cpp
		* tinyxml

	NOTE: ParticleUniverse is closed-source and NOT GPL compliant. Sadly, there's no workaround for the time being and that prevents the game from redistribution. The plan is to port the current scripts to use the free ParticleFX plugin instead. Please visit http://blog.vertigo-game.com for updates on the topic.

  Make sure Ogre and Bullet can be found by pkg-config, if not, refer to their manuals. Once ready, just type:
    make
