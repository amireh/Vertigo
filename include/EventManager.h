     *  \brief
     *  Creates, releases, registers, and fires Events, the EventManager makes
	 *	for the interface for subscribing EventListeners to be notified upon
	 *	dispatching of certain Events. Also acts as a Factory for the creation
	 *	of Events and releasing them.
     *
     *  \remarks
     *  All Event interaction should be done via this interface;
     *  when a component would like to trigger an event, it first has to
	 *	retrieve a newly created instance by calling createEvt(), then 
	 *	enqueue it by calling hook(). From there on, it's this module's job
	 *	to make sure all EventListeners interested in this Event are notified
	 *	when the Event's turn has come in the queue.
