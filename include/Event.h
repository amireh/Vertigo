     *  return to that state; once an Event is hooked to the
     *  handler, it waits until it can be processed by the queue.
     *  Once eligible, it will be flagged as PROCESSING, during
     *  this state, all subscribers to Event are called to handle.
     *  Until all subscribers register as being done handling the Event,
     *  it is flagged as DONE and unhooked.

     *
     *  \remarks
     *  When a MAJOR Event is being processed, and a MINOR Event
     *  has been hooked, priority is given to the minor Event.
     *  Once the minor Event is done, the priority is given back to
     *  the last major event.
     *
     *  This mechanism is useful against certain Events that require
     *  the player's interaction; such as a response to an interface
     *  menu could be considered a Major event, because the Event
     *  will not be processed until input is made by the User. However,
     *  Events such as moving units or casting a spell are considered
     *  to be minor Events, since the processing of these Events is not
     *  dependant on user input.
	 *
	 *	\warning
	 *	Subclasses of Event MUST implement a copy constructor, see Event::clone()
