- the game now compiles on Linux and Mac OS X systems

[Graphics]
- implemented basic particle systems:
  - fire "blaze" effect: fire spheres are now engulfed in flames and leave a fire trail
  - ice "steam" effect for ice spheres

- implemented a "Motion Blur" effect which will be used when the sphere transitions
  between tunnels
- a "screen shake" effect is now in place to notify the player of an unhealthy collision

[Physics]
- collision between the sphere and obstacles is functional now

[Gameplay]
- shield state is now being tracked

-- Rv2 --

[Gameplay]
- introduced obstacles
- sphere can now flip shields

[Physics]
- integrated BulletPhysics
- defined primitive world collision boundaries: two static planes to imitate

- the player's sphere owns a rigid body now
- sphere and obstacles are alive now and affected by central forces

-- Rv1 --

[General]
- app skeleton is defined and the systems to be used are integrated, namely:
  - Ogre with nVidia's CG shader library
  - CEGUI

[Graphics]
- terrain geometry is now rendered (tunnel)
- player sphere is rendered with two materials for each shield
