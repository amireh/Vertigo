stuff done:

* all OgreBites::Button* references in UIEngine do it explicitly
* sfxengine no longer references or creates intro track
* OGG sounds fall back to WAV on mac
* loading scene is cleaned up in game manager
* settings are no longer strings
* taking screenshots on mac now stores them in the bundle under Contents/Resources

* physics framerate independence (ugly code in GameManager)
* chase obstacles no longer track the player's Z

* fixed spawning/collision issue.. using vector for obstacle pool now instead of list
